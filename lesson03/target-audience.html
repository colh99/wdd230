            <h2>Jace Steelchaser</h2>
            <div><img src="images/portrait1.jpg" alt="persona picture 1" width="400"></div>
            <p>Jace is 24 years old, and is about to finish his studies on his homeworld of Corellia, to become an 
                engineer. He is considering several locations where he might want to seek a job and possibly settle
                long-term. He is considering Cloud City because he knows of the unique scenery, but he isn't
                sure if the industry here is very strong compared to more well-known locations in the galaxy, and 
                having lived in a big population center for most of his life, he is worried he would be bored living
                in a relatively smaller place. He uses his desktop computer to view our site.

            <h2>Cara Adoran</h2>
            <div><img src="images/portrait2.jpg" alt="persona picture 2" width="400"></div>
            <p>Cara is a 33 year-old actor from Naboo who is looking for a unique place to spend a vacation with her husband. 
                She has never heard of Cloud City, but the name got her attention when she saw an ad for a local hotel.
                She wants to know what kind of entertainment is in the area, and what the main attractions are. She 
                enjoys going new places and trying new things, but obviously there are a lot of options in the galaxy,
                and so she wants to be sure that Cloud City can be both a relaxing and adventurous vacation spot. She 
                primarily uses a small tablet to browse the holonet.
